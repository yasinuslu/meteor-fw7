meteor-fw7
==========

Provides Framework7 for Meteor (currently)


#TODOS

Some of the aren't about todos. Create another project that extends framework7 or maybe create pull request.

### Meteor and Framework7 integration
- Dig into framework7's source code and find out how pages works
- Framework7 should somehow support custom transport methods. Currently it does ajax requests and there is no easy way to customize it.
- Build a wrapper around Framework7 that bridges meteor and Framework7
- Integrate Iron Router with Framework7 using that wrapper

### Android
- Right know framework7 doesn't seem to have good performance on Android.
- Add android theme for Android look'n feel.
- Maybe replace some of animations with Famous.
